            <div class="bio-body">I’m a highly motivated Materials Engineer with over ten years working in the paints & coatings industry for two major regions, South America and the Middle East, with a strong background in FBE powder coatings. During this multicultural journey, I gradually discovered the impact and power of data and how properly delivered information could change the business direction by deriving insights, explaining context and scenarios to define and execute the best-fit strategy. These experiences made a data visualization and analytics enthusiast, continuously learning and deepening the data analytic skills and tools to create value. I’m passionate about excellence and always looking for smarter and more efficient ways to get things done.</div>

            <div class="bio-body">I'm an expressive introvert, a collector and interpreter of information, and a purposeful collaborator. I love learning and sharing what I learn with others, whether in presenting or in writing. I've enjoyed my work most when I'm supporting a change: providing business input, composing documentation, and conducting training sessions for a system migration to better customers; consolidating audits to limit the number of contact points with operational staff; ensuring a smooth transition for clients, staff, and auditors after a business is acquired or sold; launching the company's first diversity-based virtual employee resource group and moving the needle on LGBTQ inclusion. I was born and raised in Texas, still enjoy Minnesota winters, love learning languages (learning Norwegian and Finnish currently), and follow the Eurovision Song Contest.</div>
